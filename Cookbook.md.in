document shows examples of its use.

## Generating a web site <a name="website-example"></a>
[FIXME]: # (Add example use of an executable fragment (date))
[FIXME]: # (Add an example about uniquely numbered invoices)

Suppose a web site has the following page design, from top to bottom: logo,
navigation menu, breadcrumb trail, page body.

Most of the elements are the same on each page, but the breadcrumb trail has
to show the canonical path to each page, and the logo is bigger on the home
page, which is the default `index.html`.

Suppose further that the web site has the following structure, where each
line corresponds to a page:

$paste{sh,-c,build-aux/dirtree test/cookbook-example-website-expected | build-aux/indent-preformatted | sed -e 's/\.html//g' | grep -v index}
    └── Home page

* Home page
* People
    * Jo Bloggs
    * Hilary Pilary
* Places
    * Vladivostok
    * Timbuktu

The basic page template looks something like this:

$paste{sh,-c,build-aux/indent-preformatted < test/cookbook-example-website-src/template.html}

Making the menu an included file is not strictly necessary, but makes the
template easier to read. The pages will be laid out as follows:

$paste{sh,-c,build-aux/dirtree test/cookbook-example-website-expected | build-aux/indent-preformatted}

The corresponding source files will be laid out as follows. This may look a
little confusing at first, but note the similarity to the HTML pages, and
hold on for the explanation!

$paste{sh,-c,build-aux/dirtree test/cookbook-example-website-src | build-aux/indent-preformatted}

Note that there is only one menu fragment (the main menu is the same for
every page), while each section has its own breadcrumb trail
(`breadcrumb.html`), and each page has its own content
(`main.html`).

Now consider how Nancy builds the page whose URL is
`places/vladivostok.html`. Assume the source files are in the directory
`source`. According to the rules given in
the [Operation](README.md#operation) section of the manual, Nancy will look
first for files in `source/places/vladivostok.html`, then in
`source/places`, and finally in `source`. Hence, the actual list of files
used to assemble the page is:

* `source/template.html`
* `source/logo.html`
* `source/menu.html`
* `source/places/breadcrumb.html`
* `source/places/vladivostok.html/main.html`

For the site’s index page, the file `index.html/logo.html` will be used
for the logo fragment, which can refer to the larger graphic desired.

[FIXME]: # (Explain how to build the web site statically, or serve it dynamically.)

This scheme, though simple, is surprisingly flexible; this simple example
has covered all the standard techniques for Nancy’s use.

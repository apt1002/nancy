Nancy is a simple web site builder. It has just one construct:
context-dependent file inclusion. With this single feature you can
build pretty much any web site whose logical structure mirrors its URL
layout, and which does not rely on dynamically computed content, out
of fragments (of HTML, CSS, text, and whatever else you like) plus
other files (images, audio &c.).

Nancy is available from http://rrt.sc3d.org/Software/Nancy/. It is
free software, licensed under the GNU GPL.

See "Nancy user's guide.pdf" for instructions.

Any questions, comments, or bug reports should be sent to Reuben
Thomas (see above for address).


To install Nancy, copy nancy.pl to a directory where executables are
found, and the WWW and File directories to a Perl library directory.

To install WebNancy, copy webnancy.pl to a CGI script directory, and
configure the web server to pass all URLs for the site to the script.
Configuration for Apache (in an .htaccess file) looks something like
this:

# Direct URLs to Nancy
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^$ /ROOT/cgi-bin/webnancy.pl
RewriteRule ^(.*)\.html$ /ROOT/cgi-bin/webnancy.pl

Nancy is a simple file weaver. It has just one non-trivial construct:
context-dependent file inclusion. A file can either be included literally,
or run as a command and its output included.

Nancy was originally designed to build simple static web sites, but can be used for all sorts of other tasks, similar to more complicated systems like [AutoGen](http://autogen.sourceforge.net) and [TXR](http://www.nongnu.org/txr).

Nancy is free software, licensed under the GNU GPL version 3 (or, at
your option, any later version), and written in Perl.

See [the user guide](Nancy user's guide.pdf) for instructions and examples.

Please send questions, comments, and bug reports to the maintainer, or
report them on the project’s web page (see above for addresses).

## History

I gave a talk about an early version of Nancy at the
[Lua Workshop 2006](https://www.lua.org/wshop06.html). (Back then it was
written in Lua!)
